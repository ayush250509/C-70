                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

While social distancing has definitely resulted in some social and economic challenges for many, it also seems to be improving our air quality since travel has decreased across the board significantly. Researchers in New York are reporting early results, saying that carbon monoxide levels produced by cars has decreased 50% in comparison to this time last year. China and Italy have also reported significant air pollution decreases since the outbreak.</p>

        <h4>If fossil fuel emissions go unchecked, there is a possibility of sulphur dioxide emissions increasing four-fold in India by 2020</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In asia as well, the situation is about to reach alarming proportions. Given the fact that the two most populous countries of the world -- China and India -- have substantial reserves of coal, the continent remains a region where coal use is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. Fortunately, for India, the sulphur content of coal found in the country is consistently low. But this is not the case with China. There are several sources of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide emissions, including power generation and transport and even household energy use for cooking, using a variety of fuels. In fact, the Rains-Asia model, on which the iit scientists worked, indicates the possibility of a 315 per cent increase in so 2 emissions over present levels in India by the 2020. They have reported that ecosystems exceeding the critical load will rise from zero to 15 per cent between 1990 and 2010. Otherwise, it could reach 50 per cent. According to Mohan and Kumar areas exceeding the critical load are mainly located in southeast Bihar, West Bengal and Delhi. Critical load is the maximum deposition of pollutants that will not damage the ecosystem. It is calculated on the basis of the ability of a system to buffer the acidity due to the supply of acidic compounds and varies from place to place.
